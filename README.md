# Online Tech Support 
This project was developed using Core Java programming language and uses MySQL as its database. JDBC connector was utilized to establish connectivity between the Java application and the MySQL database. This online tech support system was designed to provide 24x7 access to employees, engineers, the Head of the Department and the administration to quickly resolve technical issues related to hardware and software. The system was developed with a user-friendly interface, allowing registered users to easily access various features and functionalities according to their specific roles.

Question -
The system will be available on an online platform for 24x7 access to the employees, the engineers, the Head of the Department and the administration. It Helps keeping your IT staff productive with fast, accurate, remote technical support for your System environment. It provides defect support for a broad range of Products running on System hardware.
Factors to consider include cost of downtime, skills, retention, overheads, customer satisfaction, and many others.
Employees of the organization uses IT based hardware for their daily work. If by some reason, these hardware goes down it is very important to take care of these hardware and in case of fault , that should be repaired in priority basis.

Engineers from this department take care of the problem.

**Users:**
1. HOD
2. Engineer
3. Employee

**Roles for the HOD:**<br>
